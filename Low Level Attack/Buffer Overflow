    - Memory allocation
        - Before copying of data from source to destination, a program
        needs Memory to the destination.
        - Sometimes, programs make mistake and fail to allocate enough
        memory to the destination.
        - Data will be copied to the destination buffer more than 
        the amount allocated.
            - This will result in memory overflow.
        - Most people think that the damage of this mistake is only 
        buffer overflow. 
            - However, what is surprising is that such simple mistake
            can cause an attacker to control the program fully.
            - If a program with such vulerability is running with 
            privileges, then attacker will be able to gain those 
            privileges.
