- Concept
    - Environment is defined by env't vairables
    - Env't vairables are set by
        - system
        - operating system
        - others by shell
        - any program that loads another program
    - When you login to the system
        - Shell under goes a phase called initialization
        - initialization is two process
            - Shell checks /etc/profile exist
                if exist read it else skipped
            - Shell checks .profile on your home directory
                if exist read it else skipped
            - /etc/profile
                - Maintained by the system admin
                - Contains shell informations required by all users on the system
            - .profile
                - This is under your control
                - You can add as much shell customization information as you want
                    - type of terminal you use
                    - list of directory in which to locate commands
                    - list of vairables affecting the look and feel of terminal
                - Setting the PATH
                    PATH = /bin:/user/bin
                - How to use env't variables
                    - envp : only inside main function
                    - environ : global variable                                                                                                          Ã¬                                    a  s   df n        j a sd   f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
                    (other than scope, they are the same interms of functionalty)                             
                    example
                        #include <stdio.h>

                        extern char** environ;
                        void main(int argc, char* argv[], char envp[]){
                            int i = 0;
                            while(envp[i] != NULL ) {
                                printf("%s\n", envp[i]);
                                i++;
                            }

                            // OR

                            int k = 0;
                            while(environ[k] != NULL ) {
                                printf("%s\n", environ[k]);
                                i++;
                            }
                        }

                - How does process get env't vairables
                    - New process is created by the system call 
                        - Child process inherite parent process env't vairables
                    - Process runs a new program in itself typically using 
                    execve() system call
                        - In this case old environment variables are lost
                        - execve () can be invoked in a special manner to pass 
                        env't variables.
                            int execve (
                                const char *fname,
                                char *const argv[],
                                char *const envp[]
                            )
                        examples
                            v[0] = "/usr/bin/env"; v[1] = NULL;
                            execve(v[0], v, NULL);
                            - Passing no environment variables

                            newenv[0]="AAA=aaa"; newenv[1]="BBB=bba"; newenv[2]=NULL; 
                            execve(v[0], v, newenv);
                            - Passing a new set of environment variables

                            extern char ** environ;
                            ...
                            execve(v[0], v, environ);
                            - Passing a all the of environment variables

            - /proc : a virtual file system in linux
                - Contains a directory for each process
                - use process ID as name of the directory
                - example
                    - /proc/932/environ
                        - Contains env't variables for process 932
                    - /proc/$$/environ
                        - Contains environment variables for the current process
                - to print out the text in the virtual file use "strings"
                as follows
                    strings /proc/932/environ
        - Shell variables and environment variables
            - Shell Variables and Environment variables are two different things
            - In Computing, Shell is a command line interfercae for user to interact with
            the operating system.
                - example: Bourne shell, Bash, Dash, C Shell
            - Shell Variables are internal variables maintained by shell program
                - affects shell behaviour and also used in shell script.
                - Shell provides built in commands to create, assign, and delete
                    - create & assign : FOO=bar
                    - display : echo $FOO
                    - delete : unset $FOO
            - However, shell variables can become environment variables and environment
            variables can be shell variables.

            - Shell Variables >>> Program Starts >>> Copy Environment Variables to Shell
                (Therefore changes made to shell variables in the child variables 
                will not be reflcted on the Environment Variable)

- Attack surface caused by environment variables
    - The hidden usage of the environment variables is dangerous
    - Env't variables must be sanitized before usage.
        - Since they can be set by the users
    - The attack surface can be categorized as follows
        - Linker
        - Application
            - Library
            - External Program
            - Application Code
    - Attack Via Dynamic Linker
        - The linking in dynamic linker is conducted during runtime unlike static
        linker.
        - Libraries supporting dynamic linking are called shared libraries.
            - in unix .so suffix
            - in Microsoft DLL 
        - Steps for running programs in Dynamic linking
            - Loading : Executable is loaded into memory first.
                - Linux ELF executables, a standard file format for executables, 
                contains a .interp section that specify the name of dynamic linker
                    - which itself is a shared library (ld-linux.so)
            - Dinamic Linker: after loading dynamic linker finds printf or any other 
            function that needs linking 
                - finds the implimentation  from shared libreries 
                - link the invocation function from executable to the actual 
                implimentation code function
            - Jump to main : After linking finished the main takes control
        - we can use ldd command to see what shared libraries the program depends on
            gcc -o dynamic_prog dynamic_prog.c
            ldd dynamic_prog
        - LD_PRELOAD and LD_LIBRARY_PATH
            - LD_PRELOAD : contains list of shared libraries, which will be 
            searched first by dynamic linker
            - LD_LIBRARY_PATH : is colon-separated set of directories where libraries
            should be searched for the first, before the standard set of directories.
            - Since these two variables can be set by the user, There is a posiblity
            for the user to alter the outcom of the dynamic linking.
            - If the program is previleged Set-UID program, the use of this env't 
            variable by dynamic linker may lead to security breaches.

                /* mytest.c */
                int main() {
                    sleep(1);
                    return 0;
                }

                - run it
                gcc mytest.c -o mytest
                ./mytest

                - Create your own sleep function
                /* sleep.c */
                #include <stdio.h>

                void sleep (int s){
                    printf("I am not sleeping");
                }
                - Compile the sleep function
                gcc -c sleep.c

                - create a shared library with newly created sleep function inside it
                gcc -shared -o libmylib.so.1.0.1 sleep.o 

                - include it in LD_PRELOAD 
                export LD_PRELOAD=./libmylib.so.1.0.1 

                - now run the mytest program and you will get...
                ./mytest
                I am not sleeping
