I. SWITCH, TRANSISTORS AND MEMORY
====================================
- Think about the switch 
    - Switch it on stays on, switch it of it stays of
    - Even the bulb is burns out, you can still look and tell whether the light 
    is on or off by the position of the switch.
    - In a sense the switch remembers what last command was until you change it
    - That means light switch represents rudimentary memeory element
    - In general Memory is an aggregate of switches that retain a pattern long
    enough for that pattern to be read and understood by a person or a 
    mechanism.
    - Memory consists of containers for alterable patterns that retain an
    entered pattern until someone or something alters the pattern.

- Transistor switches
    - Problem in the switch is that they require fingers to set them
    - Ideally, a computer memeory switchs should be operated by same force.
    - This type of switch is relay. Relay is a mechanical switch that is 
    operated by electricity for the purpose of controlling electricity.
    - you flip relay by feeding it a pulse of electricity.
    - Fully electronic computers are made out of transistor switches.
    - Transitors are tiny crystals of silcon that use the pecuilar electrical
    properties of silicon to act as switches.

                   |        |-------< Output

    - Memory cell is a name given for transistor switch and its support 
    components.
    - The presence of voltage indicates a binary 1, and the lack of voltage 
    indicates a binary 0
    - A memory cell holds one binary digit either 1 or 0
    - A bit is a single binary digit, either 1 or 0
        - is an indivisible atom of information
- Shrinking bit
    - One bit doest tell much. We need to bring a lot of memory cells together.
    - The size of the cristal cip hasnt changed outrageously since its first 
    creation but transistors themselves have shrunk almost incredibly.
    - In the begining on chip held one transistor, in time semiconductor 
    designers criscrossed the chip into four equal areas and made each area 
    independent transistors. 
    - Then the shrinking process began First 8 bits then 16 bits all the same 
    tiny silcon chip and by late 1960's 256 memory cels could occupy on silcon
    chip.
    - Now cyou can purchase this little plug-in circute board memory module
    with as much as 2 gigabytes as much as 16 billion bits.
- Random Access
    - What the word Random indicates is that you can reach into a random-access 
    memory and pick out an of the bits it contains without disturbing the others
    - Works like this:
        - Inside the chip each bit is stored in its own memory cell
        - Each of the memory cells has a unique number
        - This number is a cell address
    - Each chip has number of pins coming out of it.
        - The bulk of this pins are called address pins
            - The address is a binary number, expressed in 1s an 0s only
        - One pin is the data pin
            - Depending on whether you want to read or write the data pin is 
            switched.
    - Look on fig 3.2 on page 53
- Bytes, Words. Double Words and Quad Words
    - 1 byte = 8 bits side by side
    - 1 Word = 2 bytes side by side = 16 bits
    - 1 double word = 2 words side by side = 32 bits
    - 1 quad word = 2 double words side by side = 64 bits
    - Every byte memory has its own unique address 
    - When 32-bit computers access a byte it actually reads 4 byts statrting 
    of the requested byte. You can use the remaining 3 bytes or ignore.
    - If you ignore the 3 bytes, then you will have to access memeory again.
- Centeral Processing Unit (CPU)
    - But who is going doing the reading and writing operations on the memory.
        - Its a single chip called CPU
    - If you are the president and the CEO of your computer
        - CPU is the shop forman, who sess that your orders are carried out 
        down among the chips, where the work gets done.
    - Other than CPU plenty of work is done in memory system and peripherals
        (peripherals are USB, display board, and network ports)
    - While the CPU does good deal of work it also delegates.
