- 32-Bit Registers
    - General-Purpose Registers
        - Data Registers (EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX)
            - EAX : primary accumulator
                - used in input/output
                - arthimetic
            - EBX : known as base Registers
                - used in indexed addressing
            - ECX : known as count Registers
                - start loop count in iterative operations
            - EDX : known as data register
                - used for multiply and divide operations involving large 
                numbers
        - Pointer Registers (EIP, EBP, ESP)
            - IP : stores the offset address of the next instruction in 
            association with CS register.
            - SP : in association with SS register refers to current 
            position of data or address with in the program stack.
            - BP : helps in referenceing parameter variables passed to a 
            subroutine.
        - Index Registers (ESI, EDI)
            - SI : It is used as source index for string operations.
            - DI : used as destinationn index for string operations.
    - Control Registers
        - Overflow Flag (OF) : indicates the overflow of high order bit
        - Direction Flag (DF) : determines the left or right direction 
        for moving or comparing string data.
            0 : left to right
            1 : right to left
        - Interrupt Flag (IF) : determines whether the external interrupts
        like keyboard entry , etc., are to be ignored or processed.
        - Trap Flag (TF) : Allows setting the operation of the processor
        in single-step mode. DEBUG program used to set trap flag.
        - Sign Flag (SF) : Shows sign of the result of an arthmetic 
        operation. 0 : postive; 1 : negative
        - Zero Flag (ZF) : Indicates the result of arthimetic operation
        0 : non-zero result; 1 : zero result
        - Auxiliary Flag (AF) :  conatains cary from bit 3 to bit 4
        - Parity Flag (PF) : indicates total number of 1-bits in the result
        obtained from arthimetic operation. 0 : even; 1 : odd
        - Carry Flag (CF) : indicates the carry of 0 or 1 from higher order
        bit (leftmost) after an arthimetic operation. 
    - Segment Registers
        - Code Segment (CS) : Contains all instruction to be executed
            - CS register contains the starting addess of code segment.
        - Data Segment (DS) : Contains data, constants and work areas.
            - DS register stores the starting address of data segment.
        - Stack Segment (SS) : Contains data and return address of a 
        procedures or subroutines.
            - SS register stores the starting address of the stack.
        - External Segment (ES) : Spare segment that may be used for 
        specifying a location in memory.
