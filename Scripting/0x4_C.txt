- Pointer
  - Pointers separates C from other programming languages
  - Pointer is a variable that stores memory address
  - Advantages of pointers
    - pointers are more efficient in handling arrays and structures
    - we use pointers to get reference of a variable or function
    - pointers allows dynamic memory allocation
    - increase execution speed of program
- Reference operator &
  - & : gets the memory address of the variable
  - syntax 
    &var_name
- Dereference Operator *
  - Dereferencing is the process of retriving the value at memory location 
    pointed by the pointer
  - Syntax
    *pointer_variable
    *memory_address
- Declaring pointer variable
  - syntax
    data-type *pointer-variable-name
    - data-type is valid C data type
    - * symbol specifies it is a pointer variable
  
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int main()
    {
      int num = 10;
      
      printf("Value of num = %d\n", num);
      printf("Address of num = %d\n", &n);
      printf("Value of num = %d\n", *(&num));
      
    }

   
- Pointer to Constant
  - Restricts the modification of value pointed by the pointer
